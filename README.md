Hi, I am Danny Miracle I live in Southeast Kentucky and I feel I have said "I" too many times already. LOL. 

I'm 38 years old. I currently attend EKU for political science with hopes of law school. Yes, it's late in life, but I believe in pursuing dreams. HOWEVER, I have alwas been interested in coding and I feel that coding will be large part of our future and the evolution of humanity, so I figured this is a good time to learn and become acquainted and maybe even network some! I look forward to working with all of you!
